>>> how do i inject local PDF files into this model for use
To inject local PDF files into your model, you'll need to follow these general steps:

1. **Load the PDF file**: Load the local PDF file using a library or framework that supports PDFs, such as `pdfjs` (a popular JavaScript library) or a Python library like `PyPDF2`.
2. **Convert the PDF to a suitable format**: Convert the loaded PDF file into a format that your model can understand and process. This might involve:
        * Converting the PDF to an image (e.g., PNG, JPEG) using libraries like `pdf2image` or `pdf-image`.
        * Extracting text from the PDF using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) tools like `Tesseract-OCR` or `Python-ocr`.
        * Encoding the PDF file as a binary string or base64-encoded string, which can be used to represent the PDF in your model.
3. **Prepare the data for injection**: Prepare the converted data according to your model's requirements. This might involve:
        * Tokenizing the text extracted from the PDF (e.g., using NLTK or spaCy).
        * Resizing images or converting them to a suitable format for your model.
        * Encoding binary strings or base64-encoded strings as numerical inputs for your model.
4. **Inject the data into your model**: Use the prepared data to train, test, or fine-tune your model. This might involve:
        * Creating datasets with labeled examples of PDFs and their corresponding outputs (e.g., text extracted from the PDF).
        * Using the prepared data as inputs for your model during training or inference.

Here are some code snippets in Python using popular libraries to give you an idea of how this process might work:

**Loading a local PDF file using pdf2image**
```python
import pdf2image

pdf_file = 'path/to/local/pdf/file.pdf'
images = pdf2image.convert_from_path(pdf_file)

# Convert the images to PNG format
png_images = [img.save('output.png', 'PNG') for img in images]
```

**Extracting text from a PDF using Tesseract-OCR**
```python
import pytesseract

pdf_file = 'path/to/local/pdf/file.pdf'
text = pytesseract.image_to_string(pdf2image.convert_from_path(pdf_file)[0])

# Preprocess the extracted text (e.g., tokenization, stemming)
tokens = [word for word in text.split() if word.isalpha()]
```

**Encoding a PDF file as a base64-encoded string**
```python
import base64

pdf_file = 'path/to/local/pdf/file.pdf'
with open(pdf_file, 'rb') as f:
    pdf_data = f.read()

base64_encoded_pdf = base64.b64encode(pdf_data)

# Use the base64-encoded string as input to your model
```

Remember that the specific steps and libraries you use will depend on your model's requirements, the type of data in your PDF files, and your programming language of choice.
